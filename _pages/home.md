 I'm Cyrille Doux, a PhD student in astrophysics and cosmology, currently working at [Laboratoire AstroParticule et Cosmologie](http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/) of [Universit√© Paris-Diderot](http://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/), Paris, France.

I am working on cross-correlations, that is, the combination of multiple cosmological probes (CMB, galaxies, gravitational lensing, hydrogen clouds, etc.) from various experiments. I am also interested in more fundamental/theoretical matters, such as dark energy and (loop) quantum cosmology. My PhD dissertation can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gjbim1ju2pb1e3p/DOUX_Cyrille_these_20171204.pdf?dl=0).

I am a member of several science collaborations: [SDSS](http://www.sdss.org/), [LSST](http://www.lsst.org) and [Euclid](http://sci.esa.int/euclid/).

And I'm co-organizer of the [French Physicists' Tournament](http://france.iptnet.info), an innovative training for undergraduate students *by* and *for* research supported by the French Academy of Science and the French Physical Society (in which I am a member of the ["Junior" commission](https://jeunes.sfpnet.fr/)).
