I'm Cyrille Doux, a postdoctoral researcher working in the field of cosmology at the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](http://www.physics.upenn.edu/) of the [University of Pennsylvania](www.upenn.edu) with Prof Bhuvnesh Jain. I'm also postdoctoral fellow at the [Warren Center for Data and Network Sciences](http://warrencenter.upenn.edu/). Before that, I completed a PhD at [Laboratoire AstroParticule et Cosmologie](http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/) of [Université Paris-Diderot](http://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) in Paris, France. And even before, I studied theoretical physics at the [Ecole Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr/) in Paris.

I mainly work in the field of observational cosmology, with an interest on multi-probe analysis, i.e. using large galaxy surveys (DES, LSST) and cosmic microwave background observations at the same time to measure cross-correlations and better constrain cosmological models. I'm also interested in tackling various problems related to gravitational lensing in galaxy surveys with deep-learning techniques, such as deblending or galaxy interactions in clusters. Finally, I am also keen on more theoretical matters, such as dark energy and (loop) quantum cosmology. My PhD dissertation (in English) can be found [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01829118).

I am a member of several science collaborations: [SDSS](http://www.sdss.org/), [LSST](http://www.lsst.org) and [Euclid](http://sci.esa.int/euclid/).

Outside of work, I was vice president of the [French Physicists' Tournament](http://france.iptnet.info), an innovative training for undergraduate students *by* and *for* research supported by the French Academy of Science and the French Physical Society (in which I am a member of the ["Junior" Commission](https://jeunes.sfpnet.fr/)).
