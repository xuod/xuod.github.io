## Research experience

**2014-2018** PhD at [Laboratoire AstroParticule et Cosmologie](http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/) with [Ken Ganga](http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/~ganga/) and Eric Aubourg on the *Combination of cosmological probes*. I visited Princeton multiple times to work with [Prof David Spergel](http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~dns/) and [Emmanuel Schaan](http://www.princeton.edu/~eschaan/) and participated to 3 [LSST DESC](http://lsst-desc.org/) meetings (Oxford, SLAC & BNL). My publications are on the arXiv [here](http://arxiv.org:443/find/astro-ph/1/au:+doux_c/0/1/0/all/0/1). I teach tutorial classes on newtonian mechanics to maths freshmen.

**2013** Research internship at [Berkeley Lab](http://www.lbl.gov) with [Bob Cahn](http://phyweb.lbl.gov/~rncahn/www/cahn.html) on the BigBOSS galaxy survey (now [DESI](http://desi.lbl.gov/)).

**2012** Summer internship at the [CHARA Array](http://www.chara.gsu.edu/), a 6-telescopes stellar interferometer at Mount Wilson Observatory with Judit Sturmann.

## Education

**2011-2015** [Ecole Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr/en) (ENS is the top academic institution in France and 5th world-wide in the ARWU *per capita* ranking, with about 2400 students and 800 researchers and teachers.) I received a 4-year fellowship as a trainee civil servant at ENS, where I got a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in theoretical physics. I also studied maths (probabilities/stochastic processes), cultural geography, philosophy of economics, social antropology, japanese, german, spanish, etc.

**2008-2011** Preparatory classes (maths-physics stream) at Lycée Marcelin Berthelot in Saint-Maur, France.

## Outreach

**2016-2018** Co-organiser of [Int'l](http://2016.iptnet.info)/[French](http://france.iptnet.info) Physicists' Tournament (vice-pres' in 2018): an innovative training for undergrad' students *by* and *for* research. The recipe: 8 months to prepare 17 open and fun physics problems, before comparing results during *Physics Fights* ! In 2016, we received 120 students from 14 countries and had a budget of about 100k€. The FPT is supported by the French Academy of Science and the French Physical Society.

**2016** [Festival Paris-Montagne](http://paris-montagne.org/science-academie): presentations in junior high schools on the expansion of the Universe.

**2015** *Un chercheur, une manip'*: general audience presentation of the [Planck satellite](http://sci.esa.int/planck/) at the [Palais de la Découverte](http://www.palais-decouverte.fr/en/home/), Paris science museum.

**2011-2013** Weekly scientific workshops with preschoolers with the association [ASTEP](http://www.fondation-lamap.org/fr/astep), which is part of 1995 Nobel Prize Georges Charpak's *La main à la pâte* initiative that promotes science at school.
