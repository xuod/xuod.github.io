## Research interests

**Observational cosmology**: My PhD research focused on the combination of cosmological probes including CMB lensing, galaxy clustering, weak lensing and the Lyman-α forest, and exploring how they can be used to 1) improve statistical constraints on the parameters of various cosmological models, 2) detect new signals and observables and 3) mitigate experimental systematics.

**Statistical and numerical methods**: I am also interested in exploring methods such as bayesian inference methods, deep learning techniques for galaxy survey images analysis and in developing new ways of data compression adapted to joint analyses.

**Theoretical physics**: I have interest in modified theories of gravity and their cosmological implications, as well as in loop quantum gravity.

**Collaborations**: member of [SDSS](http://www.sdss.org/), [LSST DESC](http://lsst-desc.org/) and [Euclid](http://sci.esa.int/euclid/).



## Publications

1.	**First detection of cosmic microwave background lensing and Lyman-α forest bispectrum**. **Cyrille Doux**, Emmanuel Schaan, Eric Aubourg, Ken Ganga, Khee-Gan Lee, David N. Spergel, Julien Tréguer. *Physical Review D*, 94, 103506. [arXiv:1607.03625](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03625) (2016).
    *We detected a correlation between the amplitude of the fluctuations in the Lyman-α forest and CMB lensing convergence along the same line of sight, a purely non-linear effect.*
    A [non-technical synopsis](https://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevD.94.103506) on APS's *Physics* magazine came the publication of the article.

2.	**Cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of cosmic microwave background and spectroscopic tracers of the large-scale structure**. **Cyrille Doux**, Mariana Penna-Lima, Sandro D. P. Vitenti, Julien Tréguer, Eric Aubourg and Ken Ganga. *MNRAS* 480, 5386–5411. [arXiv:1706.04583](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04583) (2018).
    *We develop a method based on pseudo-spectra to simultaneously analyze galaxy clustering, CMB lensing and CMB temperature fluctuations that includes cross-correlations and apply it to Planck and SDSS-III/BOSS data to constrain the wCDM model and the mass of neutrinos.*
